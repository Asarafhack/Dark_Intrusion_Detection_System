## Ethical purpose only ,its under education dont misuse its followed by education guideness
## Features

- **Simulate DDoS Attack**: Simulate a DDoS attack to test your systems' robustness.
- **Detect DDoS Patterns**: Analyze and detect DDoS patterns from network traffic logs.
- **Visualize Logs**: View logs with a graphical representation of DDoS activity.
- **Generate Report**: Generate detailed reports of DDoS activities in PDF format.
- **Exit**: Exit the program gracefully.

## Requirements

### Python Version
This project is built with Python 3.7+.

### Install Dependencies
